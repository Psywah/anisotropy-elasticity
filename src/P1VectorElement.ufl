# The bilinear form a(du, v) and linear form L(v) for
# a hyperelastic model.
#
# Compile this form with FFC: ffc -l dolfin -fsplit -fquadrature_degree=2 -feliminate_zeros -fprecompute_basis_const -fprecompute_ip_const HyperElasticity.ufl
# ffc -l dolfin  -fquadrature_degree=1 -feliminate_zeros -fprecompute_basis_const -fprecompute_ip_const -fsplit HyperElasticityA.ufl

# Function spaces
VecCG = VectorElement("Lagrange", tetrahedron, 1)

# Trial and test functions
u = TrialFunction(VecCG)     # Incremental displacement
v  = TestFunction(VecCG)      # Test function

a = dot(u,v)*dx
